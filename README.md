# Main Branch
This repository is created to test the branching structure

The main branch is the gold-standard branch which will have a clean deliverable.

Any changes/ updates to the main branch will come from pseudo_main/ Release branches

## Pseudo_main/Release Branches

The release branches are the point of contact between main branch and the dev branch.

One release branch will be created for every checkpoint.

## Dev Branch

The Dev branch is the place for continuous integration (CI). 

Any and every modifications performed by the researchers will be committed to Dev branch alone. 

Once the code in dev is ready for release, it is merged to the lastest release branch. 

## <researcher_name> function Branch

These are sub branches/ the lowest level of branch created for independent work.

The researcher has full flexibility in making modifications to this branch. 

Best Practice: Keep this branch upto date with the Dev branch. 

Any merge should be done only to the Dev branch and every merge should be performed after reviewing the pull request. 

The commit section will now reflect on the flow of commits for this line.
